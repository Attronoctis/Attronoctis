## Introduction

Considering the vast selection of available programming languages one can rightfully feel overwhelmed. Yet certain classification criteria [1,2] are available, guiding our choices when taking into account our aims and endgoals. Some languages will be better suited for certain problems, hence choosing a fitting one saves time and headaches on the long run [3]. Being enlightened about industry standards is another good practice [4].

## Language Selection

Let's see then what my personal choices are, taking into account my preferences, industry standards, and my goals.

### Number One: C++

The industry standard in game development [5,16], this language was originally created to improve upon C [6]. Its biggest strength is its versatility [7], enabling it to be used for programming operating systems, applications, and simulations [8].
Hence, in my case, the choice falls to this one due to:
- game development (with Unreal Engine) application aligning with my long-term goal
- creating scientific & engineering simulations in my shorter-term goals
- cybersecurity applications [4] also aligning with my shorter-term goals
- relatively fast and versatile: being "low-level" enough and closer to machine-operations, yet "high-level" enough to allow for advanced uses [9]

### Number Two: Python

I have a love-hate relationship with this one language. I constantly refer to it as being "so high level it makes its users dumb". Yet I cannot deny its versatility in scientific computing or data science [4] and being an industry standard (taking first place on the PYPL list in 2023 [4]), possibly due to its open-source nature and vast selection of packages [10]. However, one of its biggest drawbacks it its slowness [7].
The reason I am choosing it:
- powerful libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and SymPy specifically designed for numerical computing [11]
- as a scripting language it can be used for automation, making it useful for cybersecurity applications [12]
- its PyGame package can be a good introduction into game development for beginners [13]

**Quality resources include:** (considering I'm using Python on a daily basis and have already attended a Python workshop, I was looking for more application-oriented resources)

### Number Three: C

Yes, I've been vacillating between several ones here, including C# and Kotlin. But, I am not necessarily wanting to deal with mobile app development, while I really want to write code that is as close to hardware as possible. And while C++ is the "better" C, C is still widely used in several fields [4,14,15].
My specific reasons for choosing it:
- manual memory management and lack of higher-order features makes for a deeper understanding of programming concepts & system-level programming
- programming operating systems, kernels, and embedded systems will help with building foundational knowledge
- considering its fastness it's well suited for complex simulations
- the official Python interpreter is written in C and other interpreters can also be developed, adding to the foundational knowledge

**Quality resources include:** (some are more foundational applications through C, which is exactly what I'm aiming at)

## Conclusion

I ended up choosing C, C++ and Python as the 3 programming languages to move forward with. Python is more of an interpreted and script language, while C and C++ are compiled languages. While all of them are considered high level, there is a hierarchical structure to them, with C being the "lowest" and Python the "highest". These languages cover the application fields and goals I aim to work towards.
