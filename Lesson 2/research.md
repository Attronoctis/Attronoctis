## Introduction

Considering the vast selection of available programming languages one can rightfully feel overwhelmed. Yet certain classification criteria [1,2] are available, guiding our choices when taking into account our aims and endgoals. Some languages will be better suited for certain problems, hence choosing a fitting one saves time and headaches on the long run [3]. Being enlightened about industry standards is another good practice [4].

## Language Selection

Let's see then what my personal choices are, taking into account my preferences, industry standards, and my goals.

### Number One: C++

The industry standard in game development [5], this language was originally created to improve upon C [6]. Its biggest strength is its versatility [7], enabling it to be used for programming operating systems, applications, and simulations [8].
Hence, in my case, the choice falls to this one due to:
- game development (with Unreal Engine) application aligning with my long-term goal
- creating scientific & engineering simulations in my shorter-term goals
- cybersecurity applications [4] also aligning with my shorter-term goals
- relatively fast and versatile: being "low-level" enough and closer to machine-operations, yet "high-level" enough to allow for advanced uses [9]

## Number Two: Python

I have a love-hate relationship with this one language. I constantly refer to it as being "so high level it makes its users dumb". Yet I cannot deny its versatility in scientific computing or data science [4] and being an industry standard [4], possibly due to its open-source nature and vast selection of packages [10].
